What concerns me the most in the world? My answer is the environment. As I was a child, I could
see a lot of stars hanging in the sky. Now when I look up at the sky, I can only find very few stars.
My city has a spring called Baotu Spring, it has three springs side by side, slightly staggered. The
spring used to keep gushing out and the water was clear to the bottom. Recently, however, the
spring has been cut off several times due to groundwater extraction [1]. Also, the summer in my
memory was not as hot as it is now.
With the development of industry, the environment is gradually being polluted. We began to
have many names for the types of pollution, such as air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution,
etc. The victims of environmental pollution are not only us humans, but also animals. The case of
marine pollution is an example. Toxic metals, plastics, man-made chemicals, oil, municipal and
industrial waste, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, etc. are responsible for ocean
pollution [2]. There was a news report of an albatross chick that died just from eating a large
amount of plastic [3]. Plastic waste causes the death of up to one million seabirds each year [3].
When animals are hungry and ingest plastic, it takes up space in their stomachs leading to
starvation [3]. Protecting the environment is therefore not only for our future generations but
also for the poor, innocent animals.
We also have new words to describe various environmental phenomena. One of these terms,
global warming, is not unfamiliar to any of us and is quietly changing the environment around us.
It leads to rising average temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, some
extinction of wildlife, and many other impacts [4]. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, consisting
of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are the main contributors to
global warming [5]. The melting of glaciers due to the greenhouse effect caught my attention. To
my intense surprise, the glaciers were melting much faster than we had expected [6]. If sea levels
keep rising, countries like Netherland will disappear [7].
It is urgent to curb the greenhouse effect to protect the Earth's environment. As a result, human
beings began to discuss how to curb global warming. Then, numerous strategies have already
been developed to mitigate the greenhouse effect. For instance, the Paris Agreement was
adopted on 12 December 2015, with the reaffirmed goal of limiting global increases in
temperature to well below 2°C, while trying to get below 1.5°C. [8].
The study shows that the combustion of fossil fuels should be the largest source of greenhouse
gas emissions from human activities, releasing more than 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere each year [9]. To fight against climate change and protect the environment,
countries around the world have reached a consensus to develop non-fossil energy sources,
including renewable energy sources [10].
So, whether it is for a better life or to enjoy the life you already have, the root of it all is to protect
our environment. It is only in this way that humanity could talk about the future.
